### Research purpose and implementation plan 

With the spread of smart devices and cloud computing technology, it has become possible to receive information services regardless of location. However, because of COVID-19, now it is required to provide information services equivalent to face-to-face solutions. 

This study investigates the diffusion of cloud computing technologies in the education of higher education institutions in Japan and the Dominican Republic (the origin country of the student who is the experimenter) in the form of a questionnaire. Based on the [TAM (Technology Acceptance Model)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_acceptance_model) and [DOI (Diffusion of Innovation)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_of_innovations) theories, 75 questions will be answered in stages, and the diffusion of cloud computing technologies in education in both countries will be contrasted and analyzed. In addition, this study will be used to examine the technological requirements necessary to realize homogeneous and face-to-face education in higher education institutions regardless of location.

### Expected results 

1. By comparing the results from the survey with previous aggregated data from Sub-Saharan African universities, we will understand the diffusion of cloud computing technologies in higher education institutions by country and identify the necessary aims and decision-making trends to promote the diffusion of these technologies. 
2. In combination with the findings obtained through the mock lessons of the interactive education system, that supports the acquisition of programming and information and communication technologies that is being developed in parallel (e.g., educational data analysis and analysis of questionnaire results), we will determine the requirements for more specific utilization of cloud computing technologies in higher education institutions.

### Ethical issues in conducting research 
#### Ensuring the privacy of investigators and subjects 
* Attributes and personal information such as names and affiliations of participants will be destroyed after the completion of administrative procedures and will not be published in papers. In addition, when publishing the data in a paper, we will obtain the consent of the collaborators in the experiment to use the anonymized data after statistical processing thus individuals cannot be identified. 
#### Measures to be taken in the event of drawbacks to the investigator or subject 
* If there is a complaint by the surveyed person, the responses will be excluded from the total results. 
#### Whether or not to make public announcements, and the ethical issues that may arise and how to deal with them 
* The results of the survey will be made public, but the names of the participants and any other information that could identify them will not be shown. 
#### Countermeasures to prevent infection by the new coronavirus
* There will be no direct contact with the respondents as the survey will be requested by e-mail and responses will be made online.
